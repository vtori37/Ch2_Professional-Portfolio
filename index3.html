      <h2 class="text-dark bg-primary p-2 display-inline-block">About Me</h2>
      <p>I have always had a deep appreciation for the art of storytelling, as I believe that storytelling can
        promote human togetherness and understanding. Whether it's through my own projects or collaborating with
        others, my goal is to aid in the cultivation of ideas and creation of stories that utilize various mediums
        such as film, animation, video games, and digital media.

        I also value the importance of interpersonal skills and am a strong communicator. I am a quick learner and
        creative problem-solver, who is highly organized and takes initiative. Using these skills, I serve as a
        product manager at an e-commerce startup. My experience in this position has inspired me to pursue
        opportunities where I may leverage my degree in Business Administration in International Business to
        bridge communication between web development and product management.

        I want to further enrich my knowledge of the world of gaming, film, animation, and digital media;
        therefore, I have a desire to learn more about technical design as well as web development. This includes
        my
        enrollment in UT-Austin's Coding Boot Camp, where I am in training to become a full-stack web developer.
        Currently, I
        am deepening my understanding in newly acquired skills in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Node.js, and MySQL. I
        plan to further broaden my knowledge of web development by learning TypeScript, Java, Python and C#. In
        addition, I practice photography and my photo editing skills in Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop in my spare
        time.</p>
